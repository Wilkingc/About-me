              "\"Marya Martin is an American flautist, soloist, recitalist, and chamber musician.\\nBorn Mary Martin in New Zealand, Martin studied at the University of Auckland, where she had lessons with Richard Giese, then principal flute in the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra. After graduating in 1976, Martin was awarded a Queen Elizabeth II Arts Council grant to study at Yale University. In 1979, Martin graduated from Yale with a master's degree in flute performance.  She shortly thereafter won the 1979 Young Concert Artists International Auditions. She went on to win top prizes in the Naumburg Competition, the Munich International Competition, the Jean-Pierre Rampal International Competition, and the Concert Artists Guild—all within a two-year period. To date, Martin is the only flutist to take top prizes in all of these major competitions. In 1980, Martin made her New York concert debut. Following these successes, Martin moved to Paris to study with Jean-Pierre Rampal at the Nationale Superieur Conservatoire de Paris and then later with Sir James Galway in Lucerne, Switzerland.\\nIn 1984, she founded the Bridgehampton Chamber Music Festival which, under her artistic direction, has done much to foster the development of chamber music presented in historically appropriate settings.\\nShe has performed internationally with orchestras including the Seattle Symphony, Saint Louis Symphony, the Brandenberg Ensemble, and the Mostly Mozart Orchestra. She has also made recital appearances at Carnegie Hall, the Royal Albert Hall and Wigmore Hall in London; the Sydney Opera House; Casals Hall in Tokyo; and other venues in Paris, New Zealand, and Australia. Martin has also toured with James Galway, playing duo concerts with him. As a chamber musician, Martin has appeared with the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, Chamber Music at the Y, the Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival, Music at Angel Fire, and Bravo! Colorado. She has recorded for Musical Heritage Society, Orion Master Recording, Arabesque, New World Records, Well-Tempered Productions, Albany Records, and Kiwi Pacific Records. Martin is on the board of Young Concert Artists and is a jurist in international music competitions. She is on the faculty of the Manhattan School of Music, a position she has had since 1996.\\nMartin is married to Manhattan businessman Ken Davidson.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\""

Following these successes, Martin moved to Paris to study with Jean-Pierre Rampal at the Nationale Superieur Conservatoire de Paris and then later with Sir James Galway in Lucerne, Switzerland.\\nIn 1984, she founded the Bridgehampton Chamber Music Festival which, under her artistic direction, has done much to foster the development of chamber music presented in historically appropriate settings.\\nShe has performed internationally with orchestras including the Seattle Symphony, Saint Louis Symphony, the Brandenberg Ensemble, and the Mostly Mozart Orchestra.

He began learning keyboards and then piano with music teacher, Kathryn Bartlett. At primary school, Twist studied piano with Bevan Crabtree and began composing music in his teens.\\nTwist holds four tertiary degrees in music composition. He completed his Bachelor (2003) and Master of Music at the School of Music, University of Queensland and studied composition under Philip Bra\\u010danin, Richard Mills, Nigel Butterley, and subsequently with Ira Newborn and Julia Wolfe in New York City.  His doctoral thesis, Folio of Compositions with Critical Commentary: An exploration of musical influences and composing techniques.

The concert included Twist's adaptation of \\\"The Old Prison\\\" performed by the Brisbane Chamber Choir and the Queensland Orchestra String Quartet for its world premiere. Collins observed, \\\"[he] sets the opening simple motif over a drone with wide temporal space between the intervals alluding to the flat, open landscape. This six-note (with anacrusis) opening motif becomes the germ upon which the work is based.\\\"\\nHis track, \\\"How shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land?\\\", was broadcast by the BBC.\\nIn 2019, he was commissioned to arrange Men at Work's hit song Down Under, for the Sydney Symphony Orchestra for use at the State Memorial Service for former Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke held at the Sydney Opera House on 19 June of that year. \\nIn 2022 a cantata he composed to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the murder of Dr George Duncan premiered at the Adelaide Festival.
